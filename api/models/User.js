// In model() function below, the 'user' (1st arg) is the singular of the collection name in the mongodb. Mongo db uses it as the single unit of the same name collection.

//Encrypt password before creating a user in Mongo (Mongoose Hooks) 
// 1st arg = hook name (check Mongoose doc for hooks)
// 2nd arg = next (typical function to call when using hooks to let the program move on to the next thing to do)
// Note: since we are using a function that does sthg BEFORE we save sthg in the db, we don't have any other arg inside the 2nd function (which will only contain the next function arg) arg
